# Cardiffer wakes up from a res-chamber, confused. She walks towards where the arrows on the floor are pointing while also looking at all the other creatures there. She finally reaches the cafeteria, (the part of the building all the arrows point at) where the TV is explaining everything, she shouts in english "Anyone here from earth?", looks around, Scalley then shouts back "here!" then Cardiffer (with food they just got) sits down at Scalleys table.


< You're from earth?

> Even though i look like a anthropamorphic lizard? Yea.

< So... what are you?

> Human, of course.

< THEN WHY DO YOU LOOK LIKE THAT!?!?

> Stop shouting, people are staring at us.

< You're right. (somehow.)

> I asked the staff about 20min ago, and they said i somehow merged with a lizard when i died.

< Ah yes, that makes.. total sence.

> You?

< What about me?

> Your ears, they're big, also, you have a tail?

< wdym..?

# touches her ears and looks back at her tail

< wtf? (You're right.)

> Go ask the staff, they probably have an explanation.

< Ok, can you come with, i.. i don't know where they are.

> Sure, why not.

> By the way, what's your name?

< <name>, you?

> <name>.
